# Football Data Example

Example app to access <https://www.football-data.org/>

## Instructions

- Download the app.
- Install the dependencies (npm/yarn).
- Start the app by entering "npm/yarn run start" in the terminal.
- Then the matches from Premier league is shown as the default value.
- Use the menu on the left hand side to choose different leagues.

## Notes

- Available competitions are not dynamically fetched (since I only have access to some)
- Leaving X-Auth-Token in code is normally a security issue, but in this case it's only read-access to not important data, so left it there for convenience sake

## TODO

- [] Show played, in-progress, and completed matches differently?
- [] Enexpected token '<' App.js line 1.
